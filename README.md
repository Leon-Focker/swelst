# swëlst
This is a pure data patch and the score for swëlst - a piece for organ and live electronics. You can download everything you will need to perform this piece [here](https://github.com/Leon-Focker/swelst/releases/).
To run the pure data patch just open the "swelst.pd" file and follow the instructions there. The patch requires the [convolve~ external](https://github.com/wbrent/convolve_tilde/tree/main), which can be installed directly in pure data (go to "help" -> "find externals online").

The piece is dedicated to Matthias Geuting and the Walcker-Organ in Essen Werden.
